# Bucket Oblivious Sort (Option B - bucketorp_py)

This implementation provides a Pythonic and modular version of Bucket Oblivious Sort using simple function-based design. It is built to parallel the logic of the original C++ codebase, but focuses more on readability and high-level experimentation for benchmarking oblivious sorting algorithms.
