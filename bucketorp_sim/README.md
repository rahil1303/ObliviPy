# Bucket Oblivious Sort (Option A - bucketorp_sim)

This repository provides a minimal and educational Python re-implementation of the Bucket Oblivious Sort algorithm, adapted from the original C++ reference. It focuses on simplicity, readability, and modular structure, serving as a foundation for future extensions and comparative benchmarking.
