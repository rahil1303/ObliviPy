# Bucket Oblivious Sort (Python Implementation)

This repository implements the **Bucket Oblivious Sort** algorithm in Python, inspired by the C++ implementation. The goal is to build a modular and testable Python version that supports further experimentation, benchmarking, and integration with other oblivious data processing schemes.

## 📁 Structure

- `bucketorp_py/` – Pythonic implementation (Option B)
- `bucketorp_sim/` – Object-oriented, closer-to-paper structure (Option A)

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `numpy`

You can install the dependencies via:

```bash
pip install numpy
